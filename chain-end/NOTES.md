# Notes

## JSON Metadata for Token URI

- Metadata follows the basic format of:
  `{ "name": "Name of the image", "description": "A description of the image", "image": "https://i.imgur.com/example.png"}`
- Can use [jsonkeeper.com](https://jsonkeeper.com) to host the metadata and pass to the function
- NOTE: if using this **_off-chain_** method, if either imgur or jsonkeeper went down, the NFT would be forever lost.
